I do these things to reach the final result: 
- Create a database to store sensor data in it.
- Create a website (i use 000webhost hosting).
- Create the index.html (Javascript code incuded).
- Create the PHP file which uses the GET method to get data from another page.
- Finally test the website and add some CSS to it.
